### :bulb: My idea
A simple excuse learn and use Python as Pub/Sub and a message broker, in this case RabbitMQ,  to provisioning infrastructure triggered by event like "buy a small module" and finally monitoring all infrastructure. <br>
I love IoT, for this reason, this PoC is designed to simulate a  "SasS Product". <br>
At the end of all this, it will provision my small IoT modules. :space_invader: <br>

<br>

### :fire: Supposed problem
ðŸ’€ I need to manage a lot inputs, all of them, will be to do different tasks, like messages, deployments, and more.  Obvioulsly I will re-use data to make another jobs generate custom events, and finally ,will be use Grafana to see some analysis and tendences.<br>
ðŸ’€ Some apps have to get information but a common problem is have or develop lot of products in with different technologies like,  NodeJs,Python,Php.<br>
ðŸ’€ I would like to have a shared origin to get data and avoid RE-build or make connectors or apis for connect different components in different tech/languages


<br>

### :checkered_flag: Objetive
:heavy_check_mark: Create a simple api to centralize all "inputs" and organize work-loads by queues. 
<br>:heavy_check_mark: Each microservice consume his our queue and if need, can consume others to. 
<br>:heavy_check_mark: Each microservice do a specific tasks, <b>this is to avoid have "JUMBO-Pods"</b>.
<br>:heavy_check_mark: All microservice generate logs for future monitoring, analysis and make improvements or troubleshoot.
<br>:heavy_check_mark: All logs must to be expose in stdout, to avoid write data in the container. This way enable me to use my pods with ReadOnly Filesystem.
<br>:heavy_check_mark: Automate All tasks via microservice API-CALL environments.
<br>:heavy_check_mark: Generate a big scalability and security isolating each tasks in small actions/calls.
<br>:heavy_check_mark: Avoid tech dependences or "human-tech dependence". Each human can enjoy his own Tech/Language  *(...No, no java, please!  :joy: )*.
<br>:heavy_check_mark: The standard (input/output) will be  [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) because its an open standard and is easy to implement and easy to parse.	<br>
